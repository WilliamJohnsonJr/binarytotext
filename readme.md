# Binary Translator in Ruby
The Binary translator translates 8-bit bytes into characters, and strings them together into a message

## Setup

Mac:
In your Terminal, navigate to the directory containing the_file.rb

Run this:
```
$ irb
$ chmod +x the_file.rb
```

Now, when you want to run the translator in the Terminal, just type:
```
./the_file.rb
```

Happy Translating!
